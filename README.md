# Fibonacci Sequence Project

This is my version of implementing the [fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) both recursively and non-recursively in ruby.

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/recursion).

## Installation

Open your Terminal/Command Line. Navigate to the directory where your version will live. Type in the following:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/JonathanYiv/fibonacci.git
$ cd fibonacci
$ ruby fibonacci.rb
```

## Pre-Project Thoughts

This should be relatively easy -- I had just completed [Code Quizzes: Beginner Recursion](http://www.codequizzes.com/computer-science/beginner/recursion) where they had me implement the fibonacci sequence partially.

## Post-Project Thoughts

The project was completed in about 5 minutes. 
I looked at other student's solutions and noticed a select few were able to condense the recursive function into one line.
I have taken notes on their strategems for future usage.
